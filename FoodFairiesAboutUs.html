		<h1> About Our Mission </h1>
		<p>FoodFairies is an app with a mission to change the lives of homeless people all over the world. Founded by Elizabeth and Bailey, two members of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, this web application drops a pinpoint at the current location of a user if they press a button, indicating that they are near a homeless person. The purpose of this app is to allow people that are looking to help the homeless by giving them food, water, and blankets, but they are not sure where to find them. Upon entering your location, you can also enter any details about the person you see, regarding what seem to need or how they appear to be doing. The founders are both very passionate about this application and solving this problem and look forward to seeing where FoodFairies goes in the future!
